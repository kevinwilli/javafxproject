Most of the exception founded were mostly "IllegalArgumentException"

"IllegalArgumentException": Thrown to indicate that a method has been passed an illegal or inappropriate argument.
This may not be a runtime exception, but can leads uncorrect data entry from the user

* To solve those issues, trhows some handler on the each textfield to let the user know 
that certains characters are not allowed and not to prin tit out if the user hits the sbmit button

"NullPointerException" was the second major exception I got when trying to play around the checkbox and
 the color fot the text and the color of the background to make everything visible with the change of the color.

 * To solve that an demonstrate the understanding of the Exception and how to handle them, I creat a static
  class that extedns the exception class and trhow a try-catch block arround the slider. 
  I did not print any message but gor rid of the StackTrace in the terminal.
